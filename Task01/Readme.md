# Task 1  Data Visualization using Seaborn

## Internship Program
**DevelopersHub Corporation**

---

##  Objective
The objective of this task is to explore built-in datasets available in the Seaborn library and perform basic **data analysis and visualization** using Python. This task focuses on understanding dataset structures and representing data visually using different plot types.

---

##  Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas (used internally by Seaborn)

---

##  Datasets Used
The following Seaborn datasets were explored:
- **Tips**
- **Iris**
- **Titanic**
- **Planets**

---

##  Tasks Performed

### 1 Dataset Loading
Loaded multiple built-in datasets using Seaborn’s `load_dataset()` function.

### 2 Scatter Plot
- Visualized the relationship between **tip amount** and **total bill**
- Used:
  - `hue` to represent different days
  - `size` to represent meal size

### 3 Dataset Structure Exploration
Displayed:
- Dataset shape
- Column names
- First 10 rows using `.head()`

### 4 Histogram
- Created a histogram of **sepal length**
- Added KDE for smooth distribution visualization

### 5 Box Plot
- Visualized the distribution of **sepal width** across different **species**
- Applied color palettes for better visual clarity

---

##  Output & Insights
- Scatter plots help understand correlations between numerical variables
- Histograms reveal data distribution and skewness
- Box plots highlight variation and spread across categories
- Dataset structure inspection helps in understanding data dimensions and features

##  Conclusion
This task helped strengthen foundational skills in **data visualization**, **exploratory data analysis**, and **working with real-world datasets** using Python and Seaborn.
